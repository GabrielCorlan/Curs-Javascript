    <p><strong>What is Personal Data and how do we get it?</strong>
    <p>
    <p> Personal data is information by which a customer or visitor can be directly or indirectly identified. Sharp Academy
    obtains this data as follows:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Directly from the customer or visitor</strong></li>
        <p>
    </ul>
    <p> Sharp Academy collects personal data directly from the client or visitor, as a rule, that information provided after
    signing the contract or during its performance:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li>Name, surname, personal numerical code</li>
        <p>
            <li>Postal and email address</li>
        <p>
            <li>Phone number and more</li>
        <p>
            <li>Details of transactions carried out (purchased services, prices, payment methods)</li>
        <p>
    </ul>
    <p> Sharp Academy may also request other personal data for specific purposes, for example, when the customer or visitor
    provides a copy of an ID when concluding a study contract, with their consent.
    <p>
    <p> In addition, in order to be able to provide the best products and services, Sharp Academy may sometimes request
    information regarding the customer's or visitor's experience while using Sharp Academy products and services. This
    information can be comments or suggestions as well as recommendations.
    <p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Automatically</strong></li>
        <p>
    </ul>
    <p> In certain situations, Sharp Academy may also collect customer or visitor data through automated means. For example,
    personal data may be collected through cookies or when the visitor interacts with Sharp Academy social media pages.
    <p>
    <p> Sharp Academy may combine various customer or visitor personal data from different sources (a website, an event, etc.)
    only to serve the interests of the customer or visitor in a personalized and legitimate way.
    <p>

    we advertise, to know how you arrived at our site. We may also use cookies to identify which parts of the site you are
    interested in. We then use this information to show you advertisements and pages that we think may be of interest to
    you, to personalize the way we communicate with you, or to personalize the content of the communications we send you.
    You can opt out of them if you prefer. Personalization of content means that it will include information that reflects
    the interest you have shown in the content of our pages or offers and promotions that we think may be of interest to
    you, all in order to improve how we respond to your needs.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Why do we process personal data?</strong>
    <p>
    <p> Sharp Academy will process the client's or visitor's personal data only to ensure the best possible relationship with
    him in order to recommend the educational and professional certification services offered by Sharp Academy, before
    concluding a study contract or during the course of the study contract. The processing of personal data may be based on
    the consent of the customer or visitor, may be related to the contract or may be imposed by a legal obligation.
    <p>
    <p> We want to keep you up to date with the best offers on the products/services you are interested in. In this regard, we
    may send you any type of message (email/SMS/telephone/mobile push/webpush/etc.) with general and thematic information,
    information regarding products similar to or complementary to the ones you have purchased, information about offers or
    promotions, product information, as well as other commercial communications such as market research and opinion polls,
    and we may display personalized recommendations on the website and smartphone application. In order to provide you with
    information that is of interest to you, we may use certain data about your purchasing behavior (eg products
    viewed/purchased) to create a profile for you. We always ensure that this processing respects your rights and freedoms
    and that the decisions made on the basis of it do not have legal effects on you and do not significantly affect you.
    <p>
    <p> In certain situations, our marketing activities reflect our legitimate interest in promoting and developing our
    commercial activity. In any situation where we use information about you for our legitimate interest, we take care and
    take all necessary measures to ensure that your fundamental rights and freedoms are not affected. However, you can ask
    us at any time, by the means described above, to stop processing your personal data for marketing purposes, and we will
    comply with your request as soon as possible.
    <p>
    <p> Sharp Academy's legitimate interest may be the basis for the processing of personal data, the customer or visitor being
    able to object. Along with the legitimate interest, the processing may be based on the consent of the client or visitor,
    the need to perform the contract or a legal obligation of Sharp Academy.
    <p>
    <p><strong>When Sharp Academy asks the customer or visitor for consent for processing, he has two options: "Yes" or "No".</strong>
    <p>
    <p> Only if there is agreement to this effect, Sharp Academy will process personal data for the purpose of informing about
    Sharp Academy services, offers, promotions or special events.
    <p>
    <p><strong>What are the rights of customers or visitors regarding the processing of personal data?</strong>
    <p>
    <p> The customer or visitor has specific rights in terms of data protection, and Sharp Academy provides an environment that
    facilitates their exercise (<strong>the right of access, rectification, objection, deletion, receiving personal data or filing a complaint</strong>).
    <p>
    <p> Sharp Academy has taken the necessary precautions to ensure the customer or visitor that their data protection rights
    are properly respected.
    <p>
    <p> The customer or visitor has the right:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li>to access his personal data, modify it, restrict it, withdraw his consent or object to its processing or request its
            deletion</li>

        <p>
            <li>to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. In Romania this is the National Authority for the
            Supervision of Personal Data Processing (ANSPDCP)</li>
        <p>
            <li>to request Sharp Academy to correct any inaccuracies in his personal data.</li>
        <p>
    </ul>
    <p> The customer or visitor can exercise any of the previously mentioned rights by sending a request to the email address <strong>contact@academiaprogramatorilor.ro</strong>.
    <p>
    <p> These rights may be limited, in certain circumstances defined by law (for example, the customer or visitor will be able
    to opt out of receiving marketing communications, but will not be able to ask Sharp Academy to delete their personal
    data necessary for the performance of the contract). Such restrictions will be checked individually and communicated to
    the customer or visitor accordingly.
    <p>
    <p><strong>How does the GDPR apply to children?</strong>
    <p>

    specific services, unless the express consent of the parent or guardian has been obtained in advance) or children under
    the age of 16 of 14 in the remaining situations. If children's personal data is collected, it is processed carefully and
    only under specific safety conditions.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Can your personal data be processed by third parties for other purposes?</strong>
    <p>
    <p> If the customer or visitor expresses their consent to this or there is a legitimate interest in the use of their
    personal data, Sharp Academy may communicate this data to third parties.
    <p>
    <p> As a general rule, Sharp Academy will not disclose the customer's or visitor's personal data to a third party that
    intends to use it for direct marketing purposes, unless it has the customer's or visitor's consent.
    <p>
    <p> However, Sharp Academy may communicate the personal data of the client or the visitor to third parties, without their
    consent, in the following situations and to the following entities:

            business activities;</li>
        <p>
            <li>Public authorities: Sharp Academy may disclose customer or visitor data if required to do so by law or if it believes,
            in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary for the proper conduct of legal processes, investigations or to respond
            to any complaints or requests from the authorities;</li>
        <p>
            <li>courier service providers;</li>
        <p>
            <li>payment/banking service providers;</li>
        <p>
    </ul>
    <p> We currently store and process your personal data in Romania.
    <p>
    <p><strong>How do we protect your personal data?</strong>
    <p>

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">Wikipedia</a>.
    <p>
    <p><strong>How are cookies used?</strong>
    <p>
    <p> Cookies are used for several reasons that we will explain in detail below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no
    standard options by which cookies can be deactivated, without completely disabling all the functionalities and
    characteristic signs that they place on a site. If you are not sure whether you need them or not, it is recommended to
    leave all cookies enabled in case they provide you with the service you are using.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Disable cookies</strong>
    <p>
    <p> The use of cookies can be set in the browser settings (see the Help option offered by any browser). Keep in mind that
    disabling cookies will influence the functionality of this site, but also of other sites. Disabling cookies often
    negatively affects the appearance and operation of the site. Therefore, we recommend that you do not disable cookies.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Cookies that we place ourselves</strong>
    <p>
    <p> This site offers the newsletter subscription service, and cookies can "memorize" if you are registered or if it is
    necessary to display certain notifications, which may be useful only to users who have subscribed or only to users who
    have not subscribed.
    <p>
    <p> After you submit the data through forms similar to those found on the contact or login page, cookies can record user
    data for future written communication needs.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong>
    <p>
    <p> In special cases, we use the cookies of a reliable third party. Here, we will explain what type of third party cookies
    you can find on our website.
    <p>
    <p> This site uses Google Analytics, one of the most widespread and reliable analytical solutions on the Internet, which
    helps us understand how you use our site and how we can improve your experience. These cookies monitor, for example, the
    time spent on the site and the pages visited, which helps us to produce appropriate content that will capture your
    attention.
    <p>
    <p> For more information about Google Analytics cookies, visit the official <a
            href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> page.
    <p>
    <p> Third-party cookies monitor and measure visits to this site and help us create content that will interest you. These
    cookies monitor, for example, the time spent on the site and on the pages you visit, which contributes to optimizing the
    site and adapting it to your needs.
    <p>
    <p> We periodically test new features, but we also make some subtle changes to the way the site works. During the testing
    phase of the new features, these cookies can be used to ensure your safety and continuity of use of the site, but also
    to communicate to us, at the same time, which type of optimizations our site visitors prefer the most.
    <p>
    <p> Given the fact that we sell services, it is very important to have a broader view of the statistics of the number of
    visitors to our site who have decided to enroll in our schools, which these cookies record. This is important to you
    too, as it means we can make accurate forecasts that will allow us to monitor advertising costs to give you the best
    possible price.
    <p>
    <p> The behavioral advertising cookies that this site uses allow us to provide you with the most relevant advertising
    whenever possible by tracking your interests and showing you only things that might interest you.
    <p>
    <p> We also use buttons and/or plugins for social networks on this site, which allow you to connect to your accounts in
    different ways. For this to work, social networks, including Facebook and Instagram, place cookies through our site,
    which can optimize your profile on their sites/pages or contribute to the data that is saved from numerous reasons,
    specified in the privacy policies of these networks.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Email tracking</strong>
    <p>
    <p> With your consent, we may use email tracking technology to collect information about whether you have opened an email or
    clicked on a link within the email . We can also use Facebook pixel tracking within the e-mail, which helps us
    personalize future marketing messages on the Facebook and Instagram platforms.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Google Marketing Platform / Analytics</strong>
    <p>
    <p> Our website uses Google Analytics: a web analysis service provided by Google inc. which uses cookies. These are text
    files stored on your computer that allow an analysis of how you use the website.
    <p> If you visit certain pages on the website, the following data is stored:
    <p>
    <ul>
        <p>
            <li>Two bytes of the IP address of the user's access system</li>
        <p>
            <li>Information about the operating system of the accessing system</li>
        <p>
            <li>Browser information</li>
        <p>
            <li>The accessed website</li>
        <p>
            <li>The website from which the user accessed our website</li>
        <p>
            <li>The subpages accessed from the accessed website</li>
        <p>
            <li>The duration of the stay on the site</li>
        <p>
            <li>The date and time of visiting the site</li>
        <p>
    </ul>
    <p> The information generated by these text files about how the website was used is transmitted to a Google server in the
    USA and stored there. Google will use this information to evaluate the way the website is used, to compile reports on
    website activity for website operators and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. If
    this information is required by law to be processed by third parties on Google's behalf, Google will provide this
    information to the third parties. Their use is anonymous and is done under a pseudonym. Find more information directly
    on Google.
    <p>
    <p> If you do not want Google Analytics to have access to how you use the sites, as we said above, install a deactivation
    add-on in your browser.
    <p>
    <p> For more information about the add-on, visit this <a
            href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">site</a>.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Google Optimize</strong>
    <p>
    <p> With Google Optimize we test different variations of the website through A / B tests to see which one is the best.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Google Ads</strong>
    <p>
    <p> As a Google Ads customer, we use Google Conversion Tracking, an analysis service provided by Google Inc. If you reach
    our website via a Google ad, Google Ads will install a cookie on your computer. These cookies are not used for personal
    identification and expire after 30 days. If you visit our site within 30 days and the cookie has not expired, we and
    Google can see that someone clicked on the ad and was redirected to our site. Each Google Ads advertiser has a different
    cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be traced to advertisers' websites. The information collected from conversion cookies is
    used to generate conversion rate statistics for advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Thus, advertisers
    know the number of users who clicked on the ad and were redirected to a conversion-tag-tagged page. However, they do not
    receive any information by which users can be personally identified. If you do not want to participate in the tracking
    process, you can disable the automatic setting of cookies in the browser settings. You can also disable conversion
    tracking cookies by setting your browser to block cookies from the "googleadservices.com" domain. But remember that they
    do not receive any information that can personally identify users. You can disable the automatic setting of cookies in
    the browser settings if you do not want to participate in the tracking process. You can also disable conversion tracking
    cookies by setting your browser to block cookies from the "googleadservices.com" domain.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Facebook Custom Audiences</strong>
    <p>
    <p> In the context created by behaviorally targeted online advertising, we also use the communication tools offered by the
    Facebook social network, namely Website Custom Audiences. Essentially, how you use the data generates an irreversible
    and impersonal checksum (hash value) that can be transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. To use the
    Website Custom Audiences product, Facebook cookies are used. For more information on the purpose and scope of data
    collection and further processing and use by Facebook, as well as setting options to protect your privacy, see
    Facebook's privacy policy <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/policy.php">www.facebook.com/policy.php</a>. If you don't want to opt out of Facebook Website Custom Audiences, go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">www.facebook.com</a>.
    <p>
    <p><strong>Additional Information</strong>
    <p>
    <p> We hope that this topic is now clearer to you. As we have already said, if you are not sure that you need any
    information, it is usually safer to leave cookies enabled, this is in case there is an interaction of cookies with one
    of the functions that you need on our website.
